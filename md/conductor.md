# Conductor: P/ACP Orchestrator

{{#rfd: proxying-acp}}

The **Conductor** (binary name: `conductor`) is the orchestrator for P/ACP proxy chains. It coordinates the flow of ACP messages through a chain of proxy components.

## Overview

Conductor sits between an ACP editor and a chain of components, presenting itself as a normal ACP agent to the editor while managing the proxy chain internally.

    Editor[ACP Editor]
    
    subgraph Conductor[Conductor Process]
        F[Conductor Orchestrator]
    end
    
    subgraph Chain[Component Chain]
        C1[Component 1<br/>Sparkle]
        C2[Component 2<br/>Claude Code]
        
        C1 -->|_proxy/successor/*| C2
    end
    
    Editor <-->|ACP via stdio| F
    F <-->|ACP via stdio| C1
```

**From the editor's perspective**: Conductor is a normal ACP agent communicating over stdio.

**From the component's perspective**: Each component is initialized by its predecessor and communicates via `_proxy/successor/*` protocol with its successor.

## Responsibilities

The conductor has four core responsibilities:

### 1. Process Management

- Spawns component processes based on command-line arguments
- Manages component lifecycle (startup, shutdown, error handling)
- For MVP: If any component crashes, shut down the entire chain

**Command-line interface:**
```bash
# Agent mode - manages proxy chain
conductor agent sparkle-acp claude-code-acp

# MCP mode - bridges stdio to TCP for MCP-over-ACP
conductor mcp 54321
```

**Agent mode** creates a chain: `Editor → Conductor → sparkle-acp → claude-code-acp`

**MCP mode** bridges MCP JSON-RPC (stdio) to raw JSON-RPC (TCP connection to main conductor)

### 2. Message Routing

Routes messages between editor and components:

**Editor → Component messages:**
- Messages from editor to Conductor are forwarded to the first component
- Preserves original message ID
- First component initializes subsequent components via `_proxy/successor/*`

**Component → Component messages:**
- Components use `_proxy/successor/request` to send to their successors
- Conductor doesn't need to route these—components talk directly via stdio pipes

**Response messages:**
- Flow back through the chain automatically via stdio
- Each component can transform responses before passing upstream

### 3. Capability Management

The conductor performs a two-way capability handshake during initialization:

**Proxy Capability Handshake:**
- **For non-last components (proxies)**: Conductor offers `proxy: true` in `_meta` field of InitializeRequest
- **Component must accept**: Proxy components MUST respond with `proxy: true` in `_meta` field of InitializeResponse
- **For last component (agent)**: Conductor does NOT offer `proxy` capability (agent is just a normal ACP agent)
- **Handshake failure**: If a component offered the proxy capability doesn't respond with it, conductor fails initialization with error "component X is not a proxy"

**Why a handshake?** The proxy capability is an *active protocol* requiring components to handle `_proxy/successor/*` messages. Unlike passive capabilities (like "http"), proxy components must actively participate in routing. The two-way handshake ensures components can fulfill their role.

**MCP bridge capability (future):**
- Components may declare MCP servers with ACP transport (`"url": "acp:$UUID"`)
- Conductor will handle bridging if agent doesn't support `mcp_acp_transport`
- See [MCP Bridge](./mcp-bridge.md) for details

### 4. MCP Bridge Adaptation

When components provide MCP servers with ACP transport (`"url": "acp:$UUID"`):

**If agent has `mcp_acp_transport` capability:**
- Pass through MCP server declarations unchanged
- Agent handles `_mcp/*` messages natively

**If agent lacks `mcp_acp_transport` capability:**
- Bind TCP port for each ACP-transport MCP server
- Transform MCP server spec to use `conductor mcp $port`
- Spawn `conductor mcp $port` bridge processes
- Route MCP tool calls:
  - Agent → stdio → bridge → TCP → conductor → `_mcp/*` messages backward up chain
  - Component responses flow back: component → conductor → TCP → bridge → stdio → agent

See [MCP Bridge](./mcp-bridge.md) for full implementation details.

## Initialization Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Editor
    participant Conductor
    participant Sparkle as Component1<br/>(Sparkle)
    participant Agent as Component2<br/>(Agent)

    Note over Conductor: Spawns both components at startup<br/>from CLI args
    
    Editor->>Conductor: acp/initialize [I0]
    Conductor->>Sparkle: acp/initialize (offers proxy capability) [I0]
    
    Note over Sparkle: Sees proxy capability offer,<br/>knows it has a successor
    
    Sparkle->>Conductor: _proxy/successor/request(acp/initialize) [I1]
    
    Note over Conductor: Unwraps request,<br/>knows Agent is last in chain
    
    Conductor->>Agent: acp/initialize (NO proxy capability - agent is last) [I1]
    Agent-->>Conductor: initialize response (capabilities) [I1]
    Conductor-->>Sparkle: _proxy/successor response [I1]
    
    Note over Sparkle: Sees Agent's capabilities,<br/>prepares response
    
    Sparkle-->>Conductor: initialize response (accepts proxy capability) [I0]
    
    Note over Conductor: Verifies Sparkle accepted proxy.<br/>If not, would fail with error.
    
    Conductor-->>Editor: initialize response [I0]
```

Key points:
1. **Conductor spawns ALL components at startup** based on command-line args
2. **Sequential initialization**: Conductor → Component1 → Component2 → ... → Agent
3. **Proxy capability handshake**:
   - Conductor **offers** `proxy: true` to non-last components (in InitializeRequest `_meta`)
   - Components **must accept** by responding with `proxy: true` (in InitializeResponse `_meta`)
   - Last component (agent) is NOT offered proxy capability
   - Conductor **verifies** acceptance and fails initialization if missing
4. **Components use `_proxy/successor/request`** to initialize their successors
5. **Capabilities flow back up the chain**: Each component sees successor's capabilities before responding
6. **Message IDs**: Preserved from editor (I0), new IDs for proxy messages (I1, I2, ...)

## Architecture

### Core Types

```rust
struct Conductor {
    /// All components in the chain (spawned at startup)
    components: Vec<ComponentProcess>,
}

struct ComponentProcess {
    name: String,
    child: Child,
    stdin: ChildStdin,
    stdout: BufReader<ChildStdout>,
    stderr: BufReader<ChildStderr>,
}
```

### Message Flow

Conductor manages message routing between editor and all components:

**Startup:**
1. Parse command-line args to get component list: `["sparkle-acp", "agent-acp"]`
2. Spawn all components, creating stdio pipes for each
3. Wait for messages

**Message routing:**

1. **Editor → Conductor messages** (from editor's stdin):
   - Forward to **first component** (index 0)
   - Preserve message ID
   - Special case for `acp/initialize`: Add `proxy: true` capability before forwarding

2. **`_proxy/successor/request` from any component**:
   - Determine which component sent it (by reading from that component's stdout)
   - Unwrap the inner message
   - Forward to **next component in chain**
   - Special case: If next component is last, omit `proxy: true` capability

3. **Responses** (JSON-RPC responses, not requests):
   - Match response ID to know which component should receive it
   - Forward appropriately (back toward editor or back to requesting component)

4. **`_proxy/successor/response`** (wrapping a response):
   - Unwrap the inner response
   - Forward back to the component that sent the original `_proxy/successor/request`

### Concurrency Model

For MVP, use a threaded model with message multiplexing:
- **Main thread**: Reads from editor stdin, routes to first component
- **Component reader threads**: One thread per component reading stdout, forwards to appropriate destination
- **Error threads**: One thread per component reading stderr, logs errors

Conductor needs to track message IDs to route responses correctly:
- When forwarding editor message to Component1: Track `(message_id → editor)`
- When forwarding `_proxy/successor/request`: Track `(message_id → component_index)`

Later optimization: async I/O with tokio for better performance.

## Error Handling

### Component Crashes

If any component process exits or crashes:
1. Log error to stderr
2. Shut down entire Conductor process
3. Exit with non-zero status

The editor will see the ACP connection close and can handle appropriately.

### Invalid Messages

If Conductor receives malformed JSON-RPC:
- Log to stderr
- Continue processing (don't crash the chain)
- May result in downstream errors

### Initialization Failures

If component fails to initialize:
1. Log error
2. Return error response to editor
3. Shut down

## Open Questions

1. **Component discovery**: How do we find component binaries? PATH? Configuration file?
2. **Configuration**: Should Conductor support a config file for default chains?
3. **Logging**: Structured logging format? Integration with existing Symposium logging?
4. **Metrics**: Should Conductor expose metrics (message counts, latency)?
5. **Security**: Do we need to validate/sandbox component processes?
