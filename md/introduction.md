# Symposium ACP

This repository contains Symposium's implementation of the [Agent-Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/).

## For Users

**If you want to build something with these crates**, see the rustdoc:

- **[`sacp`](https://docs.rs/sacp)** - Core SDK for building clients, agents, and proxies
- **[`sacp-cookbook`](https://docs.rs/sacp-cookbook)** - Practical patterns and examples
- **[`sacp-conductor`](https://docs.rs/sacp-conductor)** - Running proxy chains

The `sacp` crate includes a [`concepts`](https://docs.rs/sacp/latest/sacp/concepts/) module that explains how connections, sessions, callbacks, and message ordering work.

## For Maintainers and Agents

**This book** documents the design and architecture for people working on the codebase itself.
